# MetaSUB Figures
This repository contains the code used to generate figures for the MetaSUB Main Paper Released August 2019.

To run the notebooks in this repository you will need a copy of the [MetaSUB Data Packet](https://s3.wasabisys.com/metasub/data_packets/metasub_data_packet_v1_2.tar.gz). Figure code is roughly organized by where it appeared in the final manuscript but some panels have been moved around.

Please ask questions or report concerns using github's issue feature.
